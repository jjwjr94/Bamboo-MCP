# Meta Advertising Best Practices by Vertical and Campaign Goal (US Market)

Below we present best practices for Meta (Facebook & Instagram) ad campaigns, organized first by industry vertical and then by campaign objective. Each section outlines guidance on campaign structure, targeting, creative strategy, bidding/budget, measurement/optimization, and placements. All recommendations are tailored to the U.S. market and current Meta platform norms, with citations for credibility.

## E-commerce

Vertical Focus: E-commerce advertisers (online retail) typically aim to drive product sales (often using Conversions or Catalog Sales objectives), but also run upper-funnel campaigns for brand growth. Key themes are leveraging Meta's AI-driven optimization, broad reach with precise pixel tracking, and engaging product-focused creatives.

### Brand Awareness

#### Campaign Structure
- Use a dedicated Brand Awareness or Reach campaign to introduce your brand or new products broadly
- Avoid mixing awareness and conversion goals in one campaign – keep awareness campaigns separate for clarity
- If you have multiple product lines, you can either consolidate into one campaign (to maximize delivery and reach) or separate by product category if messaging is very different
- Ensure Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO) is on to let Meta allocate budget to the best-performing ad sets automatically

#### Targeting
- Go broad with your audience. For awareness in e-commerce, Meta's algorithm performs well with minimal restrictions – you can target broad demographics (18-65+, nationwide or key regions) and let the system find interested users
- Interest targeting can be used if your product is niche (e.g. outdoor gear interests for an outdoor apparel brand), but avoid hyper-segmenting or layering too many interests, which can fragment delivery
- Include Custom Audiences like website visitors or engagers only if you specifically want to raise awareness among those warm audiences; otherwise, focus on new reach

#### Creative Strategy
- Showcase your products in eye-catching ways. Use short videos or high-quality images that highlight product features or tell a brand story
- Since these ads optimize for impressions, make the brand name and visuals memorable – e.g. logo placement and a clear value proposition
- Video ads should introduce the brand within the first seconds and ideally run ~15 seconds for better completion rates
- Keep text overlay minimal and ensure it's readable in mobile feed
- Engaging, creative content is crucial – remember that on Meta's platforms "the product itself – and the creative (how you present the product)" are what drive success

#### Bidding & Budget
- Use the Brand Awareness objective (which optimizes for estimated ad recall lift) or Reach objective if you prefer maximum unique reach
- For awareness, Lowest Cost bidding is typically used to get the most impressions for your budget
- Set a daily budget that can comfortably achieve broad reach (Meta will show estimated reach – adjust until it's large enough for your goals)
- If using Reach objective, consider capping frequency (e.g. 1–2 impressions per user per week) to avoid overexposure
- Large e-commerce brands often invest heavily in Q4 for holiday awareness, so be prepared for higher CPMs in the U.S. during that season

#### Measurement & Optimization
- Key metrics for awareness campaigns are reach, impressions, frequency, and estimated ad recall lift
- Use Brand Lift studies if budget allows, to measure actual recall or brand favorability in the U.S. audience
- Monitor frequency to ensure you're not wasting spend on the same people excessively
- Although conversions aren't the focus, track post-engagement metrics (like site traffic or follow-on ad performance) to see if awareness efforts lead to downstream actions
- You can also create retargeting audiences of users who engaged with videos or ads (for later conversion campaigns)

#### Placements
- Enable Advantage+ (Automatic) Placements to maximize reach across Facebook and Instagram inventory
- For awareness, high-impact placements like Facebook Feed, Instagram Feed, Instagram Stories, and Reels are recommended to capture attention visually
- In-Stream Video placements (within video content) can also work well for mass reach in the U.S., providing a brand-safe, sound-on environment for your ads
- Ensure creatives are optimized for each placement (e.g. vertical 9:16 for Stories/Reels, 1:1 or 4:5 for feeds) so that they display properly and engage users
- Automatic placements will adjust delivery to where CPMs are cheapest – often a mix of feeds, stories, and video will be utilized to get broad exposure


### Reach

#### Campaign Structure
- The Reach objective is similar to Brand Awareness but focuses purely on maximizing the number of people who see the ad
- Use a Reach campaign when you need to touch as many unique users as possible (for example, a mass promotion or local awareness)
- Structure it with broad ad sets (e.g., one per major targeting segment or region) rather than many small ones – this ensures each ad set can reach a large audience without overlap
- Limit the number of ads per ad set to a reasonable amount (3-6 ads) to avoid diluting delivery, and use CBO if multiple ad sets to let Facebook optimize distribution of budget

#### Targeting
- As with Brand Awareness, go broad. You might use Reach campaigns for either national campaigns or local radius targeting (e.g., a local store wants to reach everyone in a 5-mile radius)
- In either case, avoid narrow interest filters; use broad demographics and location
- If local, leverage Facebook's location targeting options (e.g., "people living in or recently in this location" for a broad net, or "everyone in this location" to include travelers) based on campaign needs
- The idea is to let Facebook find all possible people in the target area and show each at least one impression
- You can also set frequency controls (at the ad set level, e.g., 1 impression every X days) to manage repetition since Reach objective allows for frequency capping

#### Creative Strategy
- Use simple, attention-grabbing creatives with a broad appeal. Since the audience is broad, emphasize universally relevant aspects of your brand or product
- Bold imagery, your logo, and a clear headline help ensure even users who just glance at the ad recall something
- Messaging can be very concise (you're not necessarily expecting clicks – it's okay to have an ad that's just "Now available: [Brand] – Shop the Fall Collection!" for example)
- High-level branding and light call-to-action (like "Learn More" or "Shop Online") are fine, but the main goal is visual impact over direct response
- Ensure the creative is optimized for mobile and uses an appropriate format (vertical/square) to occupy more screen space

#### Bidding & Budget
- With Reach campaigns, use Lowest Cost bidding to maximize impressions
- Set a lifetime budget if you plan to use the built-in frequency cap feature (Facebook will then pace your spend over the campaign duration to meet the reach & frequency goals)
- The Reach objective in Ads Manager allows you to specify a desired frequency; for example, you might aim for 1 impression per user per week for 4 weeks
- Budget should be allocated based on the size of the target audience and desired frequency (Facebook will estimate reach for your budget)
- In the U.S., expect higher costs in densely populated or competitive regions – you may need higher budgets to saturate audiences in major cities

#### Measurement & Optimization
- Focus on unique reach and frequency achieved. Ensure you are hitting the volume of people intended
- Monitor CPM as an efficiency metric – if CPMs are too high, your creative relevance or audience definition might need adjustment
- While reach campaigns aren't optimized for clicks, keep an eye on click-through rate (CTR) as a secondary indicator of ad quality (a very low CTR might indicate the creative isn't resonating, even if reach is fine)
- If your goal is awareness, consider running a brand poll or survey to see if ad recall improved in exposed areas
- You can also compare site traffic or direct traffic during the campaign period to baseline to infer impact

#### Placements
- Use wide placements (automatic) similar to Brand Awareness. Facebook and Instagram feeds are prime for reach
- Also consider Instagram Stories and Reels for younger demographics – they can greatly add to unique reach
- Audience Network and Messenger can contribute additional reach at low cost, though they may have less impact per impression; however, since you're maximizing eyeballs, including them (via automatic placements) can lower overall CPM
- The key is to fill all available channels with your message. Just ensure the creative is compatible with each placement (use the placement customization features in Ads Manager if needed, or design universal creatives that work everywhere)

### Traffic

#### Campaign Structure
- A Traffic campaign is meant to drive clicks to your website or app
- For e-commerce, traffic campaigns are often used in two scenarios: (1) Upper-funnel content (e.g., blog posts, lookbooks, product announcements) to attract potential customers and (2) "Warm-up" campaigns to gather data or build retargeting pools
- Structure traffic campaigns by segment if needed (e.g., separate ad sets for different demographic or interest groups, or separate by creative theme)
- Keep the campaign focused – don't mix too many objectives. For example, if the goal is to drive traffic to a new collection page, one campaign with a couple of ad sets (testing different audiences) is sufficient
- Use Ad Set Budget Optimization (ABO) if you want to guarantee each audience gets spend, or CBO if you trust Meta to allocate to the best-performing audience

#### Targeting
- You have more leeway to experiment with targeting here, since traffic is easier for the algorithm to achieve than purchases
- You can use broader targeting or try interest-based audiences relevant to your products to see which drives cheaper clicks
- Lookalike Audiences (e.g., 1-5% lookalike of past customers or website visitors) can be very effective for traffic campaigns, expanding reach to people similar to converters
- However, avoid overly narrow interest combos – keep audiences at least in the hundreds of thousands (if not millions) for U.S. targeting to let the algorithm optimize
- If running traffic as a warm-up for a new pixel, you might include an interest-based "cold" audience to get the pixel initial activity
- Exclude recent purchasers or irrelevant audiences to avoid wasting clicks, but you can include broad "interest expansion" to let Facebook find additional people

#### Creative Strategy
- Entice the click. Since the goal is website traffic, creatives should spark curiosity or highlight a clear benefit of visiting the link
- Use compelling headlines like "Explore Our Summer Collection" or "Read Our Ultimate Buying Guide" depending on what you're promoting
- For e-commerce products, high-quality images or videos showing the product in use can work, paired with copy that encourages users to learn more on the site
- If it's content (like a blog or lookbook), use a strong thumbnail or infographic and a teaser of the content
- Carousel ads can be useful for traffic – you can display multiple products or multiple highlights from a post, increasing the chance that one of the cards grabs attention
- Ensure the landing page experience is consistent and fast (especially on mobile). The creative's job is to get the click; the landing page then needs to engage the user further

#### Bidding & Budget
- Use the Traffic objective with the optimization set to "Landing Page Views" (this ensures Facebook optimizes for clicks that actually load your website, not just clicks that might bounce)
- Lowest cost bidding is usually best to maximize clicks; if you have a target cost-per-click (CPC) in mind, you could experiment with a cost cap bid, but it's often not necessary
- Allocate a daily budget that's sufficient to get 50+ landings a day if possible (to give the algorithm enough data)
- If you notice Facebook overspending on one ad set with CBO and not giving others a chance, you could switch to individual budgets to ensure testing each audience
- For time-sensitive traffic (like promoting a limited-time sale article), a lifetime budget with an end date can be used so Facebook front-loads delivery to that window

#### Measurement & Optimization
- Key metrics are Link Clicks, Landing Page Views, CPC, CTR, and bounce rate (the latter from Google Analytics or your site data)
- Optimize ads with low CTR by refining the creative or message – a higher CTR indicates the ad is compelling
- Watch the Relevance Score/Quality Ranking in Ads Manager; if an ad's ranking is poor, it may be driving untargeted clicks or the content isn't resonating
- Use A/B tests to compare creative variations (e.g., image vs. video) for click-through effectiveness
- If certain audiences have much higher CPC, consider pausing them or adjusting targeting
- Since the end goal in e-commerce is often conversion, track downstream behavior: are these clicks leading to people browsing products or adding to cart?
- Use the pixel data (or Google Analytics) to assess quality of traffic (time on site, pages per session)
- You can retarget visitors later with conversion-focused ads, so ensure your pixel is capturing those events

#### Placements
- Automatic placements are recommended to gather traffic at the lowest cost
- Facebook Mobile News Feed and Instagram Feed are typically top performers for link clicks
- Instagram Stories and Facebook Stories can also drive swipes (ensure you use a swipe-up CTA for stories, which now appears as a link sticker or "Learn More" swipe)
- Audience Network can sometimes yield cheap clicks, but monitor quality (they might be accidental or lower intent)
- If you find certain placements (e.g., Audience Network or Instagram Audience Network) have very high bounce rates, you could manually exclude them
- But initially, let Facebook distribute ads widely and then review placement breakdown reports
- Make sure the creative format is suitable for multiple placements or use the placement customization to upload e.g. a vertical version for Stories
- Since most traffic will come from mobile, optimize for mobile viewing and fast-loading (consider using Instant Experiences for an immersive, fast-loading post-click experience on Facebook/Instagram itself)

### Engagement

#### Campaign Structure
- Engagement campaigns (e.g., post engagement or page likes) are used to build social proof or community interaction
- For e-commerce, this might be used to boost a post (such as a product video or a user testimonial) to get likes, comments, and shares, or to grow your follower base
- Structure-wise, keep it simple: often a single ad (or a few ads) is boosted to a broad audience
- If the goal is Page Likes, use the Page Likes objective in an engagement campaign with a broad target
- If it's Post Engagement, you can run it as a post engagement ad to both current followers and lookalike/non-fans to encourage interaction
- Limit the number of ad sets – one broad ad set is often enough, or you might split by demographic if you want to ensure different messaging
- Use CBO if multiple ad sets, or just one ad set to concentrate social proof

#### Targeting
- Engagement optimization will find people likely to like or comment. This often skews toward those who are active on the platform
- You can target broadly to get a lot of cheap engagement (for example, broad U.S. audience with maybe an interest in your category)
- Another strategy is to target your existing followers or those who've interacted with your content (using a Custom Audience of your Facebook/Instagram engagers) to amplify reach among people already familiar
- For a page likes campaign, you might use lookalike audiences of customers to get relevant new followers
- Keep in mind special category rules if applicable (though for e-commerce typically not an issue)
- Overall, don't over-refine targeting for engagement; a broader net often results in more engagement at lower cost, and the algorithm will show the ad to users inclined to interact

#### Creative Strategy
- Use content that invites interaction. Questions, polls, or bold statements in your ad copy can encourage users to comment
- For example, an e-commerce apparel brand might run a photo of two styles with the text "Which would you pick for summer? Dress A or Dress B? Comment below!" to spark engagement
- Engaging visuals (bright, possibly featuring people using the product) help catch attention
- Videos that are funny, heartwarming, or instructive (tutorials) often get shares and comments if they resonate
- You can also leverage user-generated content or influencer content – these often appear more authentic and can drive higher engagement
- Important: Ensure to follow Meta's policies (don't explicitly ask for likes or shares in a spammy way, as that can reduce delivery)
- Instead, craft the content to naturally encourage engagement. Use a clear call-to-action in the copy for what kind of engagement you want


#### Bidding & Budget
- Use the Engagement objective (specifically Post Engagement or Page Likes)
- Lowest cost bidding is appropriate – you want as many engagements as possible
- The cost per engagement (CPE) can be very low (fractions of a cent for post likes, a bit higher for comments/shares) for broad content
- Set a modest daily budget to start (depending on audience size – e.g., $20-$50/day might reach a large U.S. audience if content is engaging)
- If you're boosting a specific post mainly to build social proof for later use in ads, you can also set a lifetime budget and let it run its course
- Meta will optimize to people likely to engage first; you might notice spend ramps down once those most likely to engage have seen it
- No manual bid is needed unless you see delivery issues
- For Page Likes campaigns, cost per like might be a few cents to a few dollars depending on targeting; you can set a cost cap if you have a target (e.g., $1 per like), but it's usually not necessary

#### Measurement & Optimization
- Track Engagement metrics: number of post likes, comments, shares, page likes (if that's the objective), and the overall CPE
- Also monitor reach and frequency – engagement ads might repeatedly show to the same active users
- If frequency gets high and new engagement stalls, consider refreshing the creative or expanding the audience
- Quality of engagement matters: if you get comments, review their sentiment (positive feedback indicates the content resonated; negative or spammy comments might hurt your brand image – you may need to moderate or hide inappropriate comments)
- Use engagement campaigns as a precursor: for example, after running a video engagement campaign, create a Custom Audience of people who watched 50% of the video, then retarget them with a conversion ad
- This can be powerful in e-commerce to nurture leads
- If certain demographics are engaging more (check breakdowns), you might tailor future content to them
- Lastly, track any spillover effects – often engagement campaigns can indirectly increase your followers or site visits even if not the primary goal

#### Placements
- Engagement ads should also use automatic placements. However, prioritize placements where engagement actions are possible and visible: Facebook Feed (where users can easily like/comment/share), Instagram Feed, and Instagram Explore/Reels (users can comment or at least like)
- Instagram Stories and Facebook Stories will gather replies or emoji reactions, but those are 1:1 and not public engagements – if your goal is public social proof, focus on feed placements
- In-Stream video placements are less ideal here because while people may watch, they typically can't like or comment on an in-stream ad as easily
- So you might manually exclude In-Stream or Audience Network for engagement campaigns. That said, Feeds and Reels will likely dominate delivery anyway
- Optimize your creative format for feeds (4:5 vertical video or 1:1 images) for best performance

### App Installs

#### Campaign Structure
- If your e-commerce brand has a mobile app (for shopping or loyalty), App Install campaigns can drive users to download it
- Structure these campaigns by operating system (commonly you split iOS and Android into separate campaigns or ad sets, because the user experience and conversion rates differ)
- For example, have one campaign for iOS installs and one for Android, or at least separate ad sets for each with the respective App Store/Play Store link
- Additionally, you might structure by audience – e.g., one ad set targeting broad new users, another targeting existing customers (to get them to adopt the app)
- Use CBO if multiple ad sets so budget flows to the cheaper installs
- Ensure you've registered your app with Meta and set up the Facebook SDK or App Events for tracking installs and in-app conversions

#### Targeting
- Target people likely to use your app. Often, a broad audience of relevant demographics works (e.g., 18-54, United States, maybe interests in online shopping or your category)
- You can also target lookalikes of your website customers, as they may be interested in the app experience
- Exclude current app users (if you can – Facebook's app event targeting allows targeting "not yet installed" if the SDK is tracking installs) to avoid wasting impressions
- If your app is new and you have no app user base, start broad and let the algorithm optimize for installs
- Since iOS 14+, tracking is trickier due to ATT; you might rely more on Android for fully trackable installs or use Meta's Aggregated Event Measurement for iOS
- Keep interests broad; the algorithm's install optimization will find those likely to download
- Also consider targeting by device characteristics – e.g., if it's a high-end shopping app, you might target newer device models or users on WiFi (which can imply willingness to download larger apps), though these are minor tweaks

#### Creative Strategy
- Showcase the app interface and benefits. Use video demos of the app if possible – short (15-30s) videos that walk through how easy or rewarding it is to shop on the app
- Show features like exclusive app discounts, a smooth browsing experience, or loyalty rewards to entice users
- If using static images, consider showing screens of the app or an image of a phone with your app's content on it, along with text overlays highlighting "Shop on the go" or similar value propositions
- Use the app store badges (Apple App Store and Google Play) in your creatives or copy to signal trust and where the app is available
- Call-to-Action should be "Install Now" or "Download."
- Also, mention any incentive: e.g., "Download our app and get 10% off your first purchase" can dramatically increase installs
- Keep in mind most users will be on mobile already when seeing the ad, so make the creative very clear and the install process as seamless as possible

#### Bidding & Budget
- Use the App Installs objective optimized for App Events if you have one (for example, optimize for first purchase in app if that's the end goal) or simply for installs if not
- Lowest cost bidding usually works to get volume. If you have a target cost per install (CPI) in mind (say you know an install is worth up to $5 for you), you could set a Cost Cap around that value to ensure you don't overspend per install
- Start with a healthy daily budget to give the algorithm data – enough to get at least 20-50 installs per day per ad set
- If one OS is more expensive, you can allocate budget accordingly (often iOS CPIs are higher than Android in the U.S.)
- Monitor early results and adjust: if CPIs are way above acceptable, you might refine targeting or creative, or if one platform is much cheaper, shift budget there

#### Measurement & Optimization
- Track Installs (Mobile App Install) and Cost per Install in Ads Manager. But also track downstream in-app events: e.g., how many of those installs actually registered, or performed first transaction
- This is critical in e-commerce because an install means little if they don't convert to a funded user
- If you see a big gap (lots of installs, few sign-ups), you might need to refine targeting or improve the app onboarding
- You can set up In-App Event custom conversions and view ROAS or cost per signup even if optimizing for installs
- Optimize ad sets or creatives that yield not just cheap installs, but quality ones
- Possibly shift to Value Optimization if your app can report purchase values (like investment amount), though that requires more data
- Keep an eye on Retention: are these users staying active? If not, maybe the ad messaging attracted wrong people (e.g., promising something that leads to curiosity downloads but not actual usage)
- Adjust messaging to attract more serious users – sometimes making the ad slightly less clickbaity can result in fewer but higher-intent installs
- For instance, an ad that clearly states "For U.S. residents with good credit" will reduce clicks but those who do are qualified (if that's relevant to your app)
- Also monitor by device: maybe you find iPhone users have higher lifetime value – you could then split campaigns to bid more aggressively for iOS despite fewer tracking signals, or use Apple's SKAdNetwork integrated data to judge performance
- Creative testing is important – try different styles (demo video vs. testimonial vs. simple graphic) to see which yields best install rates
- Also A/B test different value props (fast vs. secure vs. low fees) to see what resonates
- If privacy and tracking are concerns, consider running incrementality tests (turn off ads in a geo holdout to see if installs drop) because post-ATT, not all installs are attributed
- But that's advanced; likely you'll optimize based on attributed results
- Once you hit a stable CPI and decent sign-up rate, you might try switching optimization to the deeper event to see if Facebook can directly find users who will complete it (often improving quality even if CPI rises)
- And of course, feedback from app stores (reviews) could indirectly reflect ad targeting – e.g., if many new users complain "I thought this app did X but it doesn't," maybe the ad misled them – fix that to attract users who know what they're getting

#### Placements
- Use automatic placements, but focus will be on mobile-only placements since desktop users can't install a mobile app directly (Facebook can show an install ad on desktop as a prompt to send link to phone, but those convert poorly)
- So essentially, target Mobile devices only in your ad set (Ads Manager has that option under placements)
- Within mobile, Facebook Feed, Instagram Feed, Instagram Stories/Reels, Audience Network (native, interstitial) are common for app ads
- Instagram Stories often perform well for app installs if the creative is engaging (people swipe up to install)
- Reels can also be great for a quick app promo
- Audience Network can yield a lot of installs cheap, but watch quality – sometimes those are accidental clicks
- You might keep it if CPI is way lower, but check if those installs actually open the app. If not, exclude Audience Network
- Facebook Stories similarly. Messenger placements aren't too relevant for app ads (they might show in Messenger inbox but it's not a primary channel). It's fine to keep them on
- One useful format is Playable Ads (an interactive demo) – if you have a simple gamified aspect (not typical in finance apps), that could be used
- Likely not needed here, except perhaps a quick interactive tutorial, but that's heavy to produce. For most, video or image will do
- Ensure the app store page link is properly configured – when user clicks "Install," it jumps to App Store or Play Store. Test this on different devices
- Because some placements like Stories allow a swipe, ensure the vertical creative has the CTA visible
- Variation by placement: maybe have a square video for feed and a full-screen 9:16 for stories for better experience
- Let Facebook optimize distribution – it often finds IG Stories and feed combos efficient
- Typically, Instagram skews younger (good if targeting millennials for a fintech app), Facebook has broader reach including older (if you have a banking app for all ages, definitely include FB feed)
- So, cover both. Frequent observation: Instagram can drive many installs for consumer fintech apps because of the demographic match
- But older demographics for say retirement planning apps might respond more on Facebook
- Check your breakdowns and adjust if needed (like if IG is using budget but not yielding sign-ups, maybe then concentrate on FB placements)
- Otherwise, trust automatic to allocate

### Lead Generation

#### Campaign Structure
- E-commerce companies might use Lead Generation campaigns for collecting emails (for newsletters, discounts) or sign-ups for waitlists, especially if they have high-value products or long purchase cycles
- Use the Lead Generation objective with Instant Forms for a smooth user experience
- Structure campaigns based on what you're offering: e.g., one campaign for "Newsletter Sign-up – 10% off coupon" with its own form, and another campaign for "Quiz" or "Product Finder sign-up" if you have multiple lead magnets
- Within a campaign, you can test a couple of audiences (e.g., broad vs. lookalike of past purchasers) by separate ad sets
- Ensure each ad set is linked to the correct lead form
- It's often wise to keep lead gen campaigns separate from your conversion campaigns, as the optimization goal is different (leads vs sales)
- If running multiple lead forms, monitor each form's performance – you might structure by form or by audience accordingly

#### Targeting
- Target similar to how you would for conversions, since you want likely interested people
- Lookalike Audiences of customers or website visitors often perform well for lead gen (they have interest in similar products)
- Also use interest targeting relevant to your niche if you want to capture new prospects (e.g., if you sell fitness gear, target interests like "Gym, Running, Fitness apps" for lead offers like an ebook or discount)
- Keep targeting broad enough so the form has volume – a U.S. audience of a few million is fine
- One benefit in the U.S.: you can use Custom Audiences like email lists or site traffic to retarget with lead forms (for example, show a "Get a 10% off coupon" form to people who viewed products but didn't buy)
- Since Special Ad Category restrictions (housing, credit, employment) don't typically apply to general e-commerce, you can use age, gender, and interest filters freely; but if your products fall under a category (e.g., financing for purchases, etc.), you may have to run in Special Ad Category which limits targeting (only broad and location)
- For most, focus on people most likely to find value in your lead magnet content or offer

#### Creative Strategy
- Value exchange is key – clearly state what the user gets for filling the form
- Common e-commerce lead magnets include "Sign up to get 10% off your first order," "Get a free style guide PDF," "Join our VIP list for early access," etc.
- Highlight this in the ad image/text. For example, use an image of a product with "Get 10% Off – Sign Up Now" as overlay text (within the 20% text guideline) or show a sneak-peek of the PDF guide cover
- The ad copy should emphasize benefits ("Be the first to know about new drops and sales – join our list")
- Use Instant Forms that are concise: only ask for necessary info (name and email usually). The more fields, the lower the completion rate
- Use an appealing call-to-action like "Sign Up" on the ad
- If possible, enable the option for users to opt-in to Messenger or email follow-ups on the form thank-you screen for additional touchpoints
- Ensure the creative is consistent with the form's content – e.g., if the image shows a particular product or message, the form description should match that offer
- Short videos can also work to explain the value (e.g., a 15s video saying "Join 50,000 others getting style tips and exclusive offers – sign up in one tap!")

#### Bidding & Budget
- Use Lead Generation objective (Instant Forms). By default it will optimize for volume of leads
- Lowest cost bidding will get you the most leads; if lead quality is an issue, you might later experiment with a Cost Cap to aim for a certain cost per lead (CPL), but initially gather data
- Budget depends on your value per lead – if you can afford $5 per lead and want 100 leads/day, set around $500/day
- If unsure, start smaller (e.g., $50-100/day) and measure CPL
- Meta will favor easier leads – sometimes very broad audiences might yield a lot of low-cost leads that don't convert well. Monitor that and adjust (possibly by tightening targeting or adding a qualifier question in the form to improve quality)
- Facebook form leads are often cheap but can include uninterested people who clicked casually, so don't be afraid to tweak bidding strategy if needed
- As for scheduling, run it continuously but if your sales team only operates certain hours, you might schedule ads to run during those times for faster follow-up (speed to follow-up often improves conversion)

#### Measurement & Optimization
- Monitor Cost per Lead, number of leads, and form completion rate (in the Forms Library you can see how many started vs submitted)
- A healthy completion rate means your form and ad are aligned well. If CPL is high, test different incentives or simplify the form
- Track lead quality: ideally, integrate Facebook leads to your CRM or email platform and track how many leads actually make a purchase or engage further
- For example, if you send a coupon code, measure redemption rate
- If a certain audience yields lots of leads but few sales, refine targeting or messaging to filter out freebie-seekers
- Use Facebook's Lead Ad Testing tools – you can A/B test different forms (short vs long) or different creatives to see impact on CPL and quality
- Also, check the campaign's optimization metric: if you have enough data, you could optimize for a deeper event (like purchase) using the Leads objective with an offline conversion or custom conversion, but that's advanced
- Attribution for leads can be set to a short window (since form fill is immediate)
- Lastly, ensure compliance with privacy: include a link to your privacy policy in the form and only collect info you'll use responsibly

#### Placements
- Lead ads (instant forms) run on Facebook and Instagram feeds, Stories, etc., but they do not show on external sites
- Use automatic placements – primarily Facebook Feed, Instagram Feed, Instagram Stories will get delivery
- In Stories, the form opens as a fullscreen mobile form – which works well
- Keep the ad creative platform-appropriate (e.g., a 9:16 image for Stories with a "Swipe up to sign up" cue, which opens the form)
- Facebook Mobile News Feed often yields the most leads due to the easy tap experience
- Desktop can show lead ads too – on desktop the form pops up. If you find desktop leads are low quality or accidental, you could exclude desktop, but generally let it run
- One note: Facebook Messenger placement can be used with lead ads in a way (click-to-Messenger ads to collect leads via chatbot). If you have a chatbot, that's another strategy
- We recommend sticking to instant forms for simplicity. So, ensure the placement formatting is correct and let the algorithm distribute – it will likely concentrate where the easiest leads come (often mobile feeds)

### Conversions

#### Campaign Structure
- Conversion campaigns (often optimizing for "Purchase" event) are the bread-and-butter of e-commerce advertising
- Structure these with a clear funnel in mind. A common approach is to have separate campaigns for **Prospecting** (new cold audiences) and **Retargeting** (warm audiences like website visitors)
- For prospecting, you might have one campaign using broad or lookalike audiences to find new buyers; for retargeting, another campaign targeting those who added to cart or viewed products (sometimes run as a Catalog Sales campaign for dynamic ads – see next section)
- Within a conversion campaign, segment ad sets by audience type: e.g., one ad set broad (no detailed targeting, just country + age), one ad set lookalike of past purchasers, one ad set interest-based (if you have a strong interest group to test)
- Don't create too many small ad sets – that can cause overlap and learning phase issues. Consolidate where possible: Meta's delivery system in 2025 favors broader ad sets for stable performance
- Use Campaign Budget Optimization so budget flows to the best performing ad set (unless you have specific spend needs per segment)
- Keep a close eye on overlap (use the Audience Overlap tool) if you do have multiple ad sets – e.g., a broad ad set might overlap with a lookalike heavily. In such cases, it might be better to just combine them

#### Targeting
- Leverage broad targeting and Meta's AI. Post-iOS14, Facebook recommends broad audiences with the pixel signal to guide it
- For U.S. e-commerce, you can often simply target the whole country, selecting your age range of likely buyers (e.g., 18-65 if product is general, or narrower if product is age-specific)
- Add gender targeting only if your product is gender-specific
- If you have past customer data, use Lookalike Audiences 1%–5% as they can jump-start the algorithm by finding similar users
- Interests can be used for niche products (e.g., target "Golf" if you sell golf accessories), but avoid stacking many interests together – that can fragment and compete against each other
- Instead, test a single interest vs. broad rather than combining dozens
- Exclude your recent purchasers in prospecting ad sets (create a Custom Audience of purchasers last 30 or 60 days) so you're not wasting budget re-acquiring existing customers
- In retargeting ad sets or campaigns, target high-intent actions: e.g., people who viewed product or added-to-cart in last 7 or 14 days (smaller windows often perform better as the intent is fresh)
- For these, you can also exclude purchasers to avoid advertising to those who already converted
- Overall, the targeting strategy is: broad + lookalikes for prospecting, precise custom audiences for retargeting, and trust the conversion optimization to find who will buy
- This broad approach has shown to lower costs and increase reach in restricted-data environment

#### Creative Strategy
- Direct-response, persuasive creatives are needed. Highlight the product and a clear call-to-action ("Shop Now", "Buy Today")
- Use a mix of formats: single image ads (clean product photo or lifestyle image with a bit of text overlay like "20% OFF Today"), carousel ads (show multiple products or multiple features of one product; carousels often drive 30-50% lower cost per conversion than single images by showcasing variety), and video ads (demonstrate the product in use, show unboxing, or a quick testimonial)
- For prospecting, focus on your USP (unique selling proposition) – why someone should buy your product (e.g., "Eco-friendly materials", "Over 1,000 5-star reviews", "Limited time sale")
- For retargeting creatives, you can be more specific: show the exact product they viewed (via dynamic ads) or use messaging like "Don't miss out – items in your cart are almost gone!" to create urgency
- Incorporate social proof: star ratings, customer quotes, "Bestseller" badges – these build trust with cold audiences
- Also, tailor the creative to seasonality if applicable (holiday themes in Q4, etc.)
- Always include a clear CTA button (built-in on Facebook ads, choose the appropriate one like "Shop Now")
- Test different value propositions in copy – e.g., free shipping, quality guarantee, or a discount – to see what drives more conversions
- The creative is critical: as one source noted for e-commerce, the product and how you present it are what the AI and users respond to most. So invest in good visuals

#### Bidding & Budget
- Use Sales/Conversions objective optimizing for Purchase (if you have sufficient purchase events; if not, optimize for "Add to Cart" or "Initiate Checkout" until you gather enough data)
- Lowest Cost bidding is generally recommended to let Facebook spend your budget and get the most purchases
- If you have a strict cost per acquisition (CPA) or ROAS requirement, you can use Cost Cap bidding, setting the cap at your target CPA (e.g., $20 per purchase) – this can help control costs but may reduce volume if set too low
- A common approach is to start with lowest cost, gather performance data, then apply a cost cap near the observed CPA to see if you can stabilize it
- Budget-wise, allocate enough to get roughly 50 conversions per week per ad set (to exit the learning phase). For example, if target CPA is $20, an ad set should have ~$1,000/week ($140/day) to get 50 purchases
- If that's not feasible, run fewer ad sets with more budget each (consolidate audiences) so that threshold is met
- You can also use Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns – Meta's automated campaign type that consolidates targeting and creatives – which essentially uses CBO and broad targeting; many e-commerce advertisers find this structure yields efficient results with minimal manual tweaks
- It might be a separate campaign you test alongside your manual campaigns
- Keep an eye on budget allocation: if one ad set is consistently outperforming others on ROAS, consider shifting more budget there or expanding that audience
- Conversely, pause poor performers after giving enough runtime (3-5 days typically for initial learning)

#### Measurement & Optimization
- The main metrics are Purchases, Cost per Purchase (CPA), Conversion Rate, and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)
- Track these daily but evaluate with a window of a few days due to conversion delays
- Use the attribution setting that fits your sales cycle – default is 7-day click, 1-day view. If you sell low-cost items that people buy same-day, you might focus on 1-day click attribution; for higher consideration items, 7-day gives a fuller picture
- Optimize by creatives: identify which ads have the highest ROAS or lowest CPA and iterate on those (e.g., if a video ad performs best, produce more variants of that video or run it to more audiences)
- Perform A/B tests on elements like headline, imagery, or offer
- Also, analyze your funnel metrics: click-through rate, add-to-cart rate, checkout rate – if CTR is low (<1%), your ads might not be compelling enough or targeting is off; if CTR is fine but conversion rate on site is low, your landing page might need improvement or the audience isn't as interested
- Use Facebook Pixel data or Conversion API to ensure you capture all purchase events (in the U.S., many users opt-out on iOS; adopting the Conversion API can help recover some attribution)
- Leverage Facebook's Analytics or third-party tools to attribute revenue to ads, and adjust campaigns for a target ROAS
- For example, if a certain audience has ROAS 3.0 and another 1.5, scale up the former
- Additionally, consider rules or automated alerts (e.g., pause ads if CPA goes above X) to maintain efficiency
- Keep testing new creatives and fresh audiences (like new lookalikes, or broad targeting with different angles) – e-commerce performance can decay if the same people see the same ads repeatedly
- Lastly, remember external factors like stock or seasonality – coordinate your optimization around product availability and user interest peaks (e.g., back-to-school, holidays)

#### Placements
- Automatic placements are strongly recommended for conversions – this allows Meta to find the cheapest conversions across placements
- In practice, Facebook Feed and Instagram Feed typically drive the most conversions due to high user engagement and intent
- Instagram Stories and Facebook Stories can also convert well, especially for impulse purchases or visually appealing products
- In-Stream Video placements work well for video ads that demonstrate products effectively
- Audience Network can provide additional conversions at lower cost, but monitor quality closely
- If certain placements consistently show poor conversion rates or high bounce rates, consider excluding them
- But start with automatic placements and let data guide your decisions
- Ensure your creatives are optimized for each placement format to maximize performance across all surfaces


### Catalog Sales

#### Campaign Structure
- Catalog Sales campaigns are ideal for e-commerce businesses with large product inventories
- These campaigns use dynamic ads to automatically show relevant products to users based on their browsing behavior
- Structure by audience type: separate campaigns for prospecting (cold audiences) vs. retargeting (warm audiences who have interacted with your website or products)
- For retargeting, create ad sets based on different levels of intent: website visitors, product viewers, add-to-cart users, and checkout abandoners
- Use broad product sets initially, then create more specific product sets based on performance data
- Enable Campaign Budget Optimization to let Meta allocate budget to the best-performing audiences

#### Targeting
- For prospecting: Use broad targeting or lookalike audiences of your best customers
- For retargeting: Target specific website custom audiences (product viewers, add-to-cart, etc.)
- Exclude recent purchasers from prospecting campaigns to avoid wasting budget
- Use different retention windows based on purchase cycle (7-14 days for add-to-cart, 30+ days for product viewers)
- Consider creating separate audiences for different product categories if you have distinct customer segments

#### Creative Strategy
- Dynamic ads automatically pull product images, names, and prices from your catalog
- Ensure your product catalog has high-quality images and compelling product descriptions
- Use dynamic creative templates that work well across different product types
- Test different ad formats: single image, carousel, and collection ads
- Include compelling headlines and descriptions that highlight key selling points
- Use social proof elements like ratings and reviews when available in your catalog

#### Bidding & Budget
- Optimize for Purchase events if you have sufficient conversion volume (50+ per week)
- If conversion volume is low, start with Add to Cart or View Content optimization
- Use Lowest Cost bidding initially, then consider Cost Cap once you have baseline performance data
- Allocate sufficient budget for each audience segment to exit learning phase
- Monitor ROAS closely and shift budget toward best-performing audiences

#### Measurement & Optimization
- Track key metrics: ROAS, cost per purchase, conversion rate, and click-through rate
- Monitor product-level performance to identify top performers and poor performers
- Use the Product Performance report to optimize your catalog and product sets
- Test different audience retention windows to find optimal timing
- Regularly refresh your product catalog and remove out-of-stock items

#### Placements
- Use automatic placements for maximum reach and efficiency
- Dynamic ads perform well across Facebook Feed, Instagram Feed, and Stories
- Collection ads work particularly well in mobile feed placements
- Monitor placement performance and exclude poor-performing placements if necessary

## Finance

Vertical Focus: Financial services face unique challenges including regulatory compliance, trust-building, and often fall under Special Ad Category restrictions. This limits targeting options but emphasizes the importance of broad reach, compliant messaging, and building credibility through content and social proof.

### Brand Awareness

#### Campaign Structure
- Financial brands use Brand Awareness campaigns to build credibility and familiarity (e.g., a new fintech service introducing itself, or a bank launching a campaign to improve public perception)
- Structure these similar to other industries: separate awareness campaigns from direct response ones
- Use one campaign focusing on broad reach in your target market (for example, a nationwide awareness campaign for a new credit card)
- If your services are location-bound (like a regional bank or local insurance agent), you might segment by geography – e.g., one campaign per state or a single campaign with ad sets per region to localize messaging
- Keep the structure simple; since this is upper funnel, you don't need many granular splits
- Use CBO to automatically distribute budget across regions or demographics if you have multiple ad sets
- The goal is maximize reach and recall, so ensure each ad set's audience is large (special ad category will enforce broadness anyway)

#### Targeting
- Due to the Special Ad Category: Credit/Employment/Housing rules, if your campaign falls under credit (which covers loans, credit cards, insurance, etc.), you cannot target by age, gender, or certain demographics – Facebook will make you target 18-65+ and broad locations
- Interest targeting is also limited (some interests may still be allowed, but many categories are removed)
- As a result, the best practice is to go broad: target the United States (or specific states/DMAs if your service is regional) without additional filters
- Let Facebook show the ads widely to build awareness
- If not in a Special Category (say a general fintech app not offering credit, or a financial brand doing a PR campaign), you could refine by interests like "Investing" or "Small Business Owners" to focus the audience, but often it's unnecessary for awareness
- Even broad, Meta will find the likely interested folks over time thanks to its algorithmic learning
- One thing you can do is leverage custom audiences for awareness: e.g., upload a customer list and then exclude them if you strictly want new eyeballs, or conversely include a list of past customers if you're upselling them new services
- For Brand Awareness, cast wide. Financial services especially benefit from reaching diverse demographics to combat the trust barrier
- With targeting restrictions, financial marketers have shifted to relying on broad reach and first-party data rather than narrow demographic targeting

#### Creative Strategy
- Focus on trust, clarity, and brand values. In awareness ads, you're not asking them to sign up immediately; you're introducing who you are and why you're credible
- Use video or image ads that tell a story or present a key message (e.g., "Meet XYZ Bank – Banking made easy and honest" or "Your family's peace of mind, ensured by ABC Insurance")
- Storytelling via short videos (15-30s) that include your brand's mission or testimonials can leave a positive impression
- Ensure compliance: include disclaimers for any specific claims (though awareness ads usually stay generic)
- Visuals might include smiling customers, financial advisors helping clients, or simple graphics with stats (if you have a strong stat like "Trusted by 1 Million Americans" – that can be powerful)
- Avoid heavy text or too much fine print on the creative; instead use the post text or a landing page for detailed info
- Aim for an emotional connection or a problem/solution framing (without being too direct about personal attributes – e.g., don't say "Struggling with debt?" which could violate personal attribute policies)
- Instead, frame generally: "Planning for the future? We've got your back."
- Use your logo clearly so people start associating your brand name with your values
- The CTA for awareness can simply be "Learn More" linking to an about page or even "None" (just an impression ad)
- The goal is making them remember you
- Also, consider featuring any community involvement or accolades (e.g., "Voted #1 Credit Union 2025" or "Helping 500,000 families buy homes")
- These build trust. Keep the tone reassuring and authoritative, as finance is about security

#### Bidding & Budget
- Choose the Awareness objective (Brand Awareness) which optimizes for ad recall lift – Facebook will show ads to people likely to remember them
- Alternatively, use Reach if you want pure reach/frequency control
- With Brand Awareness objective, Lowest Cost bidding is fine; Facebook will maximize impressions within your budget
- Set a sizable budget for a broad audience – awareness typically has low CPMs, but you want frequency to build recall
- For example, if targeting the U.S. broadly, you might start with a budget that achieves a frequency of ~2 per person over the campaign (depending on campaign length)
- You can also use Reach & Frequency buying type if you prefer guaranteed reach and controlled frequency (this is often used by large brands to ensure, say, 10 million people see the ad 2 times each)
- That requires a fixed budget and is planned in advance. For simplicity, lowest cost auction is fine
- There's generally no need for cost cap since you're not chasing a conversion metric
- One thing to monitor is frequency – ensure your budget isn't so high that the same small audience sees it too often in a short span (which can lead to creative wear-out or annoyance)
- In the U.S., a huge population, so usually not an issue unless you restricted location heavily
- Plan budgets also around flighting if needed (e.g., higher spend in a particular month for a burst campaign)

#### Measurement & Optimization
- Brand lift is the gold standard – if possible, run a Brand Lift Test which will survey a random portion of your audience about ad recall or brand perception
- If that's not feasible, look at estimated ad recall metrics in Ads Manager (Facebook provides an estimate of how many people are likely to remember your ad)
- Also track reach and frequency
- You can indirectly measure impact by looking at direct traffic or search volume for your brand (did it increase during the campaign?)
- Optimize primarily on the creative level: are people engaging at all (though engagement isn't primary, a totally un-engaging ad might indicate it's being ignored)?
- If one ad has a higher estimated recall lift per impression (Facebook might show a relevance/quality metric), favor that creative
- Rotate new creatives every so often to keep the message fresh if you plan a long awareness campaign – seeing the same ad 10 times will have diminishing returns
- Also ensure to remain compliant: check comments if any – if you get negative feedback or questions ("Is this legit?"), that could suggest trust issues; maybe address those concerns in future messaging
- Optimize for reach among target sub-segments if needed: for instance, if you want equal awareness across age groups but see that 25-34 are getting 80% of impressions (because they're cheaper to reach), you might decide to create a separate campaign/ad set for older demographics to ensure they also see the ads, potentially with a tailored message
- Financial services often want to ensure an older audience is reached (since they are key customers but maybe less online-active)
- Finally, track any organic search or site traffic uptick – a good awareness campaign might lead more people to search your brand name or visit your site later. That's a success indicator even if they didn't click the ad

#### Placements
- Use broad placements – Facebook Feed, Instagram Feed, Instagram Stories, Facebook Video Feeds, and even Audience Network or In-Stream if you have video
- Since this is about visibility, putting your ads in brand-safe environments is a consideration: with In-Stream video (Facebook in-stream) you can ensure brand safety controls (avoid sensitive content)
- If running video, In-Stream can yield high completed views, which aids recall
- Instagram Stories/Reels are great for younger segments – a quick, visually striking awareness ad can stick in someone's mind
- Facebook News Feed probably remains core for reaching a broad US audience including older users
- Audience Network can increase reach cheaply, but those impressions might be less memorable (they appear in other apps); consider whether those add value – you might keep them for efficiency, but focus on primary placements in reporting
- If you have an image ad with a lot of text, it might not perform well; ensure it meets placement guidelines
- Possibly avoid tiny placements like the right-hand column (on desktop) for awareness, as those are small – unless you need every impression
- The goal is quality impressions where the user actually notices you. So feeds, stories, and video placements are preferred
- Turn on captions for video placements because many people watch without sound; a subtitle can convey your tagline
- In summary, go omnipresent: multi-platform (FB + IG) and multi-placement to surround your target audience with your brand message in various contexts

### Reach

#### Campaign Structure
- In finance, a Reach campaign might be used for regulatory announcements or broad messaging when you want to touch everyone in a certain area a set number of times
- It's similar to Brand Awareness but without the algorithm's recall optimization
- Structure could be a Reach campaign per region if, for example, a bank only operates in certain states and you want to ensure coverage in each
- Or one national reach campaign if appropriate
- Because Special Ad Category prevents micro-targeting, you won't be splitting by demographics – maybe only by geography or product line if needed (e.g., one campaign focusing on reaching people about auto loans, another about home loans, if you want to ensure distinct frequency for each message)
- You can also use Reach objective to cap frequency tightly (like an ad that you want everyone to see just once or twice)
- If using reach for local branch awareness, you could set up ad sets by branch radius, but that's similar to store traffic objective usage
- Keep the structure minimal, align it to how you want to allocate frequency and budget across different audience segments

#### Targeting
- Broad targeting again. With Reach, you explicitly manage frequency, so decide your audience size and frequency
- For example, target everyone in a state or city if you're a regional provider
- If the message is universal (like an FDIC announcement or a brand slogan), no need to narrow interests
- Special Ad Category still applies if relevant, so likely broad anyway
- You might choose to exclude certain overlaps if running multiple reach campaigns (like if one campaign is national and another local, ensure they don't double-serve the same people too often)
- But generally, target by location (national or regional)
- If you want to maximize unique reach, avoid any unnecessary filters
- If you're concerned about younger vs older messaging, you could do two campaigns (since age can't be targeted in credit category, you'd rely on placement maybe – but that's unreliable)
- Instead, tailor creative that speaks broadly. So the targeting instruction is basically "everyone in [your service area]"

#### Creative Strategy
- Similar to Brand Awareness, but since reach objective doesn't necessarily optimize for recall, you want the creative to do heavy lifting in being memorable
- Use simple, bold messaging that can be grasped quickly. Perhaps even more billboard-style: e.g., a static image with a succinct slogan or benefit (finance companies often do this: "Your Future. Our Support. [Logo]")
- Alternatively, if you have multiple pieces of info, you might use carousel with each card a short statement (though carousel is more interactive, not often used purely for reach)
- In any case, ensure any legally required info is present in fine print if needed (though try to keep the ad clean)
- For reach campaigns, you might also use them to deliver content pieces widely – e.g., a short video ad with key financial tips, to position your brand as a helpful expert
- The creative should align with the broad audience: no highly specific jargon; use approachable language and visuals (families, individuals of diverse backgrounds, small businesses if that's your target, etc., reflecting the community)
- Because finance is about trust, showing your brand name clearly and perhaps an image of your people or headquarters could subliminally build trust ("they're real and established")
- Keep each ad focused: if you have multiple messages, better to have multiple ads rather than a cluttered single ad
- Also be mindful of color and branding – consistency helps recognition

#### Bidding & Budget
- Use Reach objective with a set frequency cap (e.g., 1 impression per person per week, or 3 per 2 weeks – whatever suits your needs)
- Then the budget should be set to fulfill that. Facebook will estimate reach given budget and time; try to allocate enough to cover near 100% of your target audience at least once (if that's the goal)
- For example, if you're targeting a city of 1 million and want each to see it twice in a month, and CPM is, say, $10, you'd need around $20,000 (because 2 impressions * 1M people / 1000 * $10)
- Adjust these calculations with real CPM predictions from Ads Manager
- Use Lowest Cost bidding; for reach campaigns, manual bidding isn't typical
- If you absolutely have a tight cost per thousand requirement (maybe to keep costs low), you could consider the Reach & Frequency reservation tool as mentioned – it locks CPM and impressions. But flexibility is lost
- Auction with lowest cost should do fine as long as budget is sufficient
- Keep in mind seasonal costs: if you run a reach campaign during a high-demand time (Q4 holidays), CPMs may spike, so you might reach fewer people for the same budget. Plan around that if possible or increase budget

#### Measurement & Optimization
- Look at Reach (unique people reached) and ensure it's hitting your intended volume (like X% of the population)
- Also monitor Frequency to confirm it's at your set level (or slightly above if pacing issues)
- Since reach doesn't optimize for engagement or clicks, those metrics may be low – that's fine
- But if you notice extremely low engagement plus some negative feedback (like people hiding the ad), maybe the creative is not resonating; you might tweak it to be more friendly or different format
- Check Delivery Insights to see if any segments are being under-reached (though with broad targeting, it's uniform)
- If running multiple flights, you can compare brand lift or at least awareness surveys before and after the campaign to see if more people recognize the brand
- If the campaign is ongoing, swap creatives every few weeks to prevent "banner blindness" – after a person has seen the same ad a few times, additional impressions have diminishing returns
- So perhaps rotate between 2-3 ads in the campaign
- Also ensure Frequency cap is respected – if the campaign uses daily unique reach optimization, it should be, but if you see any ad set getting higher frequency than intended early, you might have too small an audience for the budget (you'd need to reduce budget or widen audience)
- In summary, success is a function of reaching the vast majority of your target audience with controlled repetition. If not achieved, adjust one of those levers

#### Placements
- As with brand awareness, stick to prominent placements. Facebook Feed and Instagram Feed for sure
- Possibly high-visibility video placements (in-stream, Reels) if using video ads
- Given reach objective, you might also utilize the Audience Network if you don't care about engagement at all and just want eyeballs – it can cheaply add impressions, but weigh that against possible lower quality impressions
- If using the Reach & Frequency buying, you can specify placements as well
- Many financial brands in awareness use primarily feed, news article (in-article) and sometimes stories
- Since a broad audience includes older folks, Facebook Feed (desktop and mobile) is important as many older users might see it on desktop as well
- So unlike some e-commerce cases, don't ignore desktop fully – include it for completeness (but optimize the creative to look good on both)
- If you have multiple aspect ratio creatives, that's great (1:1 or 4:5 for feed, 9:16 for stories)
- If not, at least ensure your main creative is centered so auto-cropping won't hide important info
- For reach, being everywhere helps engrain the message – so yes to automatic placements, just verify that the message is conveyed clearly on each (for instance, in a tiny sidebar ad it might not, but those get low spend anyway)
- Possibly exclude right-column if you think it's wasteful (it often has very low CTR and minimal impact, but also negligible spend)
- The idea is to present a professional, consistent image across the user's journey – they might see your ad on Instagram while scrolling, then later on Facebook in an article – this repetition across contexts can improve recall


### Traffic

#### Campaign Structure
- Financial services often use Traffic campaigns to drive users to their website for content (like health articles, patient stories) or to informational pages (like "Learn about our services")
- It's similar to brand awareness but aiming to get site visits for deeper engagement or tracking
- Structure by content theme: e.g., a campaign driving traffic to a blog series on heart health, separate from general info pages
- Could also use traffic to drive to a "Find a Doctor" tool or appointment page if not optimizing conversions directly (some do that if conversion pixel not set up; though lead gen objective might be better for appointments)
- If multiple audiences (like separate campaigns for different service lines or separate by geo region if multi-location health system with different websites), do accordingly
- Ad sets might test interest targeting (like an article on diabetes might target people interested in diabetes or healthy living vs another on sports injury rehab might target fitness enthusiasts), to ensure clicks from those likely to care
- ABO if you want equal promotion for multiple articles, or CBO to let one popular article get more traffic if it resonates

#### Targeting
- Content marketing in finance can leverage interest targeting if allowed: e.g., target "Investments" interest for an investing tips article
- However, in a Credit category campaign, interest options will be limited. You might still find broad categories like "Business" or "Financial services" open – not guaranteed
- A clever route is using Lookalike audiences of people who have engaged with your website or page (if you have that base); this can give a relevant audience that isn't too narrow (special category allows lookalikes but treats them as special ad audiences that are more broad)
- If you're simply promoting general financial education, targeting broadly by age range and geography might suffice, because a lot of people could be interested in improving finances
- If your content is more niche (e.g., "Retirement planning for military families"), then try to incorporate what targeting you can (maybe location near bases, or an interest in military pages – though demographic targeting of veteran status isn't available)
- Often, financial advertisers rely on broad targeting plus optimizing for landing page views to let the algorithm find who clicks through
- Do exclude people who have already converted or are not relevant (e.g., if promoting introductory content, exclude current customers perhaps, to focus spend on new prospects)
- Also consider daypart or device if relevant – e.g., if you want desktop users for a detailed whitepaper (maybe more likely to fill a form on desktop), you could tilt that way
- But in traffic objective, such refinements are secondary. The big thing: Special Ad Category restrictions mean no age/gender discrimination; your ads will reach a wide public, so ensure content is understandable and accessible to that range

#### Creative Strategy
- You're enticing a click to content, so highlight the value of that content or site visit
- Use a compelling headline or question: e.g., "How Much Should You Save for College? Find out with our free calculator." – an ad like that promises a benefit (knowledge or a tool) and encourages clicking through
- Finance topics can be dry, so consider using visuals like infographics or friendly imagery (like a family discussing finances, or an illustration) to make it approachable
- If directing to a blog post, you might use an image that represents the topic (e.g., piggy bank for savings tips)
- Ensure the ad copy has a clear hook: identify a pain point or curiosity ("Wondering how to cut your tax bill? We have 5 strategies you might not know.")
- Keep jargon minimal; assume the audience is laypeople unless your content is aimed at professionals
- If you have statistics or credentials, you can tease them ("Learn from our certified financial planners – free guide inside")
- Videos can work to summarize an article and then encourage clicking for full details on the site
- For example, a short animated explainer of a concept, ending with "learn more on our website."
- But ensure the video doesn't give everything away – leave them wanting more information that the website provides
- Call-to-Action button typically "Learn More" for educational content, or "Get Offer" if it's something like an online rate quote (but that's more conversion-y)
- If it's a direct product page (like "Check our credit card features"), use maybe "Learn More" or "Sign Up" if expecting them to maybe apply after reading (though if sign-up is the goal, conversion objective might be better)
- Also, because finance trust is key, include branding (logo, perhaps a note like "Over 100 years of expertise" if true) somewhere – it reassures them your content is authoritative, which can increase clicks

#### Bidding & Budget
- Use the Traffic objective and optimize for Landing Page Views (so Facebook optimizes for those who actually wait for your site to load)
- Lowest cost bidding to gather maximum clicks
- Calculate budget based on desired traffic volume: e.g., if you want 1,000 website visits a day and expect $0.50 per click, that's $500/day
- Financial keywords or topics sometimes get higher CPCs (competitive), but if the content is broad, CPCs could be quite low since there's a wide audience
- Start with a moderate budget (maybe enough for a few hundred clicks) and gauge quality
- If the traffic is valuable (low bounce rate, good engagement on site), scale up
- If you specifically only want high-quality clicks, you might experiment with Cost Cap on cost per landing page view – but that's rarely needed unless you see wild swings
- One thing to note: avoid using the traffic objective if ultimately you want conversions and have enough data for conversion optimization
- But if conversion events are sparse or you intentionally want to cast a wider net with content, traffic is fine
- Also, if you have a long sales cycle, traffic can be first step and you retarget later for lead or conversion – allocate budget between them appropriately (maybe 70% to traffic (top funnel), 30% to retargeting conversion)
- Additionally, consider budget for placements – sometimes you can get cheaper traffic from certain placements (like Audience Network) but those might not be ideal
- So you might indirectly manage by placement inclusion/exclusion rather than bidding differently

#### Measurement & Optimization
- Monitor Landing Page Views, Click-Through Rate (CTR), Cost per click, Bounce Rate, and time on site
- A high CTR (relative to other finance content ads) indicates your creative is resonating
- If CTR is low (<0.5% for example), test new headlines or imagery
- Bounce rate (from Google Analytics or similar) is crucial: if 90% of clickers leave immediately, either the page load is slow or the content didn't match expectations
- In that case, ensure the landing page title and the ad message align, or use Instant Experience (Canvas) for faster load
- If certain ads consistently yield longer site engagement (maybe an infographic ad leads to people spending 2 minutes reading), favor those and create similar ones
- Use A/B testing for creative elements: maybe test "5 Tips to Save Money" vs "How to Cut Your Expenses by 20%" to see which gets more clicks and engagement
- Track any downstream actions: if the content has a CTA (like "Download our guide" or "Contact us"), measure how many traffic-driven visitors take that action
- You can set up custom conversions for those and see which ads drive the most valuable traffic
- If you're building an email list or generating leads from content, track the full funnel: traffic → content engagement → lead/signup
- Optimize ad sets that drive not just cheap clicks, but engaged visitors who take desired actions
- Consider retargeting people who spent significant time on your content with more targeted offers or deeper content

#### Placements
- Automatic placements are recommended to gather traffic at the lowest cost
- Facebook Mobile News Feed and Instagram Feed are typically top performers for link clicks
- Instagram Stories and Facebook Stories can also drive swipes (ensure you use a swipe-up CTA for stories)
- Audience Network can sometimes yield cheap clicks, but monitor quality (they might be accidental or lower intent)
- If you find certain placements have very high bounce rates, you could manually exclude them
- But initially, let Facebook distribute ads widely and then review placement breakdown reports
- Make sure the creative format is suitable for multiple placements or use placement customization
- Since most traffic will come from mobile, optimize for mobile viewing and fast-loading

### App Installs

#### Campaign Structure
- If your financial services company has a mobile app (banking, investing, insurance), App Install campaigns can drive downloads
- Structure by operating system (iOS vs Android) as they often have different costs and conversion rates
- You might also structure by audience type: broad prospecting vs existing customers who haven't downloaded the app yet
- Use CBO if multiple ad sets to let budget flow to cheaper, higher-quality installs
- Ensure proper app tracking setup with Facebook SDK and App Events

#### Targeting
- Target broadly due to Special Ad Category restrictions
- Use lookalike audiences of your best customers if available
- Exclude current app users to avoid wasted impressions
- Consider device targeting (newer devices for more sophisticated apps)
- Geographic targeting based on where your services are available

#### Creative Strategy
- Showcase app interface and key benefits through video demos or screenshots
- Highlight unique value propositions like security, convenience, or exclusive features
- Use app store badges to build trust
- Include incentives like "Download and get your first month free"
- Emphasize security and trust elements crucial for financial apps

#### Bidding & Budget
- Use App Installs objective, optimizing for installs initially
- Consider optimizing for deeper events (registration, first deposit) if you have sufficient volume
- Lowest cost bidding to start, then potentially Cost Cap based on your target cost per install
- Budget for at least 50 installs per week per ad set for proper optimization
- Monitor iOS vs Android performance and adjust budget allocation accordingly

#### Measurement & Optimization
- Track installs, cost per install, and downstream in-app events
- Monitor retention rates and lifetime value by traffic source
- Optimize for quality installs, not just volume
- Test different creative approaches and value propositions
- Consider incrementality testing due to iOS 14+ attribution challenges

#### Placements
- Focus on mobile placements only (desktop users can't install mobile apps directly)
- Facebook Feed, Instagram Feed, Instagram Stories, and Reels typically perform well
- Monitor Audience Network quality closely for financial apps
- Ensure creative formats work well across all enabled placements

### Lead Generation

#### Campaign Structure
- Financial services rely heavily on lead generation for insurance quotes, credit card applications, mortgage inquiries, etc.
- Use the Lead Generation objective with Instant Forms for a seamless experience
- Structure campaigns by product or service type: e.g., one campaign for "Mortgage Leads", another for "Auto Insurance Leads"
- This way you can customize the form and messaging to each
- If you have multiple regions with different sales teams or compliance differences, you might separate by state
- Keep ad sets broad due to targeting restrictions, but you could split by broad demographic if allowed
- Ensure each ad set is linked to the correct lead form
- Often one ad set is fine (broad US, or state, or small interest-based tweak) because segmentation can hurt volume
- Use CBO to optimize budget among ad sets if you have a couple
- If different financial products have different value per lead (e.g., mortgage lead is high value, checking account lead less), keep those in separate campaigns for budget allocation clarity

#### Targeting
- Special Ad Category (Credit) likely applies (for loans, credit cards, insurance – yes; for investments, maybe not but likely yes as it's a financial service)
- So you'll mostly target broad by location
- Still, you might restrict location to where your service is available (e.g., if an insurance is only in certain states, target those states)
- Use Special Ad Audience (Lookalike) if possible built from previous leads or customer lists – this can improve targeting while staying compliant
- Interests are limited but if available, you might try very broad ones (like "Insurance" or "Finance") to see if it helps
- Often though, broad works – indeed financial advertisers have adapted to focusing on broad audiences and using algorithmic targeting with first-party data input
- So incorporate your data: create a Custom Audience of past lead form submitters or website applicants and exclude them (unless repeat business is possible)
- You can also include an industry filter if relevant – e.g., if it's a business loan lead, you might target people with Small Business Page Admin interests (if allowed)
- But careful not to shrink too much. Generally, keep it broad (like "US, 25+" as default by special category)
- Use the form questions to qualify instead of targeting – for example, ask in the form "Are you a homeowner?" instead of trying (and failing) to target homeowners
- Yes, you'll get some unqualified filling, but you can filter them out post-submit
- That's unfortunately the trade-off with limited targeting: more burden on the form or sales to qualify

#### Creative Strategy
- Focus on the offer and incentive. People don't lightly give info for finance; you need to offer something valuable
- For instance, "Get a free quote in 60 seconds", "Find out how much home you can afford – no obligation", "See if you qualify for 0% APR – check now"
- Highlight a pain point and solution: "High interest rates on your card? We can help you refinance – check your rate."
- Include a clear call-to-action in text, and possibly dynamic or personalized elements if available (like using their city name in copy can increase relevance)
- Use images that draw attention and relate to the offer: a happy family in front of a new home for mortgage leads, a shiny car for auto loans, etc.
- Finance leads also respond to numbers: if you can quote a benefit, do so ("Save up to $500/year on insurance", "Rates as low as X%")
- Just ensure you have disclaimers if needed (maybe in the fine print or form intro)
- Keep the message simple enough to digest quickly: many effective lead ads use short copy and let the form/landing do the detail
- Since it's instant form, when they click the ad, the form appears with more info – in the form description you can elaborate
- So the ad itself should mostly entice them to click "Get Quote" or "See My Rate"
- Possibly mention "No impact to credit score" if a concern, or "No obligation" to reduce fear
- For creative format, single image or carousel work well (carousel you can highlight multiple benefits or testimonials across cards)
- Video can also work: e.g., a 15s clip saying "We helped 5000 families get a mortgage with 0% down – see what we can do for you."
- But static with bold headlines often cuts through
- Also use trust signals: logos of known partners, BBB rating, "FDIC insured" if applicable, etc., either in the image or text
- People are wary of scams in online finance leads, so anything to show legitimacy (like a photo of your actual office or agent) can help
- The CTA button on the ad obviously should be "Get Quote", "Learn More", or "Apply Now" depending on context
- Ensure it matches the ask (for a soft lead, "Learn More" might understate that it's a form – better to use "Get Quote" or "Sign Up" if they will submit info)

#### Bidding & Budget
- Choose Lead Generation objective with Instant Forms
- Lowest cost bidding is typical to get volume
- If lead quality is an issue, rather than bidding, usually you'd address it via form questions or filters
- But you could theoretically use a cost cap if you only want leads up to $X cost
- Often, finance lead gen can be pricey (some insurance leads might be $20+, mortgage even more, smaller asks like credit card info might be $5-15)
- Set your budget to achieve a good number of leads per day – at least 20+ so the algorithm can learn (so if you estimate $10 per lead, $200/day)
- If budget is smaller, you can still do lead gen, just expect the learning phase to last longer
- Monitor cost per result and adjust budget or targeting accordingly
- If using multiple ad sets, CBO will shift budget to the one getting cheaper leads
- If one ad set (broad) isn't getting enough leads at a sustainable cost, you might increase budget gradually to see if cost stays stable
- Also consider the value of each lead: if a mortgage lead could be worth thousands, a $50 CPL is fine
- So optimize not just to cheapest leads but for ROI – sometimes a slightly higher CPL from a certain segment might yield higher close rates
- Schedule: leads might come more at certain hours (people might fill during work hours for insurance, etc.), but usually run all day and let FB find people when they're browsing
- You could daypart if your call center only open certain times and you want immediate call follow-up, but with instant forms you get info regardless of hour

#### Measurement & Optimization
- Core metrics: Cost per Lead, volume of leads, and lead form completion rate
- Facebook shows how many people opened the form vs submitted – if a lot start but don't finish, maybe the form is too long or they're hesitant
- Try reducing fields or making the intro text clearer about what they'll get
- Also, gauge lead quality: use the information (e.g., are these leads meeting your criteria? Many fake names/empty fields?)
- You can add a custom question like "What is 2+2?" to deter bots – quality trick
- If quality is low (e.g., wrong phone numbers), consider adding a step in the form (like a qualifying question or using higher intent form option which adds a review step)
- That can drop quantity but improve quality
- Use Facebook's Lead Filtering (some countries have it – you can put eligibility questions with disqualify logic)
- Monitor how leads progress: tie back to conversions (if you can match leads to eventual sales in an offline conversions upload, do it – then you can see which ad/target yields actual customers)
- Optimize your ads accordingly (like if one creative brings a lot of leads who never respond to calls, maybe it overpromised something – adjust it)
- Check relevance diagnostics – if score is low, maybe targeting and creative aren't aligned (though in broad, that's less relevant now)
- Always test multiple creatives: finance lead gen is sensitive to messaging changes. A slight rephrasing could double the conversion rate
- Also test the lead form itself: you can A/B test forms (maybe one with fewer fields vs one with a qualifying question) to see impact on CPL and quality
- If using a CRM, track contact rate: if certain ads yield unreachable leads (they don't pick up or emails bounce), that's a red flag
- Counter by adding a "we will contact you" note on form or using Email/Phone validation
- Additionally, consider optimizing for "Conversion Leads" – this is where you import outcome data and FB optimizes for leads likely to convert

#### Placements
- Lead ads (instant forms) run on Facebook and Instagram feeds, Stories, etc., but they do not show on external sites
- Use automatic placements – primarily Facebook Feed, Instagram Feed, Instagram Stories will get delivery
- In Stories, the form opens as a fullscreen mobile form – which works well
- Keep the ad creative platform-appropriate (e.g., a 9:16 image for Stories with a "Swipe up to sign up" cue, which opens the form)
- Facebook Mobile News Feed often yields the most leads due to the easy tap experience
- Desktop can show lead ads too – on desktop the form pops up
- If you find desktop leads are low quality or accidental, you could exclude desktop, but generally let it run


### Conversions

#### Campaign Structure
- Conversion campaigns in finance typically focus on applications, account openings, or other high-value actions
- Structure with clear separation between prospecting (cold audiences) and retargeting (warm audiences)
- For prospecting: Use broad targeting or lookalike audiences
- For retargeting: Target website visitors, form abandoners, or previous leads who didn't convert
- Use Campaign Budget Optimization to let Meta allocate budget to best-performing audiences
- Consider separate campaigns for different financial products due to varying values and compliance requirements

#### Targeting
- Special Ad Category restrictions apply for most financial services
- Target broadly by geography (where your services are available)
- Use Special Ad Audience lookalikes of your best customers
- Exclude recent customers/applicants to avoid wasted spend
- For retargeting: Target specific website actions (application started, calculator used, etc.)
- Use shorter retention windows (7-14 days) for high-intent actions

#### Creative Strategy
- Focus on clear value propositions and benefits
- Use trust signals: FDIC insured, BBB ratings, security badges
- Include specific offers: "Check your rate in 60 seconds - no impact to credit score"
- Use testimonials and social proof when possible
- Ensure compliance with all financial advertising regulations
- Include necessary disclaimers in ad copy or landing pages
- Test different value propositions: speed vs. security vs. rates

#### Bidding & Budget
- Optimize for the conversion event (application, account opening, etc.)
- Use Lowest Cost bidding initially, then consider Cost Cap based on your target cost per acquisition
- Budget for sufficient conversion volume (50+ per week per ad set)
- Financial conversions often have higher costs due to compliance and competition
- Monitor ROAS and lifetime value, not just immediate conversion costs

#### Measurement & Optimization
- Track conversion rate, cost per conversion, and lifetime value
- Monitor the full funnel: click → landing page → application → approval → funding
- Use offline conversion tracking to connect leads to actual customers
- Test different landing page experiences and application flows
- Monitor compliance and ensure all ads meet regulatory requirements

#### Placements
- Use automatic placements but monitor quality closely
- Facebook and Instagram feeds typically perform best for financial conversions
- Be cautious with Audience Network for financial products due to brand safety concerns
- Consider excluding placements that don't align with your brand's professional image
