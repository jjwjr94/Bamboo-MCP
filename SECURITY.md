## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Bamboo MCP Gateway seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@bamboo-mcp.com**

Include the following information in your report:
- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the process
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Disclosure Policy

- We will coordinate with you on the timing of public disclosure
- We prefer to fully address the issue before any public disclosure
- We will credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Multi-Provider Authentication**: Facebook OAuth 2.0 and Pipeboard API tokens
- **JWT Token Management**: Secure token generation with configurable expiration
- **Session Management**: Redis-backed session storage with automatic cleanup
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Data Protection

- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive request validation using Joi schemas
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and prepared statements
- **XSS Protection**: Input sanitization and output encoding
- **CORS Configuration**: Configurable CORS policies

### Infrastructure Security

- **TLS/SSL**: HTTPS encryption for all communications
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration management
- **Docker Security**: Non-root user containers and minimal attack surface
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security audits of dependencies

### Monitoring & Logging

- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive operation tracking
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information disclosure
- **Health Monitoring**: System health checks and alerting
- **Access Logging**: Request and authentication logging

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Code Review**: All code changes require review
2. **Dependency Updates**: Regular updates of dependencies
3. **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD
4. **Secret Management**: Never commit secrets to version control

### For Deployment

1. **Environment Isolation**: Separate development, staging, and production
2. **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege
3. **Network Security**: Proper firewall and network segmentation
4. **Backup Security**: Encrypted backups with access controls

### For Users

1. **Strong Secrets**: Use cryptographically strong JWT secrets
2. **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS in production
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep the application updated
4. **Monitor Logs**: Regular review of audit logs

## Known Security Considerations

### Authentication

- JWT tokens are stateless; revocation requires Redis blacklisting
- Facebook OAuth tokens should be validated server-side
- Rate limiting is per-user; consider IP-based limiting for additional protection

### Database

- PostgreSQL connections should use SSL in production
- Database credentials should be rotated regularly
- Consider connection pooling limits to prevent resource exhaustion

### Caching

- Redis should be configured with authentication in production
- Sensitive data in cache should have appropriate TTL
- Consider Redis encryption for sensitive deployments

## Compliance

### Data Privacy

- **GDPR Compliance**: User data handling follows GDPR principles
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary data
- **Right to Deletion**: Support for data deletion requests
- **Data Portability**: Export capabilities for user data

### Industry Standards

- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common vulnerabilities
- **SOC 2**: Security controls aligned with SOC 2 requirements
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management practices

## Security Contacts

- **Security Team**: security@bamboo-mcp.com
- **General Contact**: support@bamboo-mcp.com
- **Emergency Contact**: Available through GitHub issues for urgent matters

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as patch versions (e.g., 0.2.1)
- Documented in CHANGELOG.md
- Announced through GitHub releases
- Communicated via security advisories for critical issues

## Bug Bounty Program

We currently do not have a formal bug bounty program, but we appreciate security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. We will:
- Acknowledge your contribution
- Provide credit in our security advisories
- Consider recognition in our contributors list
